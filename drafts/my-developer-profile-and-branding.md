## My Developer Profile & Branding

Your Brand is what people out here talk about you, so it's up to you to make it good or bad, or beneficial to your career.

There are a lot of outstanding Developer profiles that we admire and look up to them for guidance and most importantly, our personal growth. There are too many articles and videos on how to market yourself as a developer, creating outstanding Resumes, and become influential on social media platforms.

I have had my share of ups and downs in personal branding, and still making my way up there. TL;DR, I'll highlight some major changes I have made.

## Creating a Resume.

My Resumes have grown to become very short and straight to the point. I have a habit of versioning my resume for easy differentiation and also avoid repetition. So far these are the key points I take when updating my resume:

- ### Make your resume as short as possible:

I learned that recruiters and hiring personnel have a number of resumes to go through for a single vacant position, and they barely have a minute to go through a single resume. So try as much as possible to make your resume short and with the most important details you'd love to share. (It's Not Rocket Science).

- ### Making your Resume ATS Compliant:

>An applicant tracking system — or ATS, for short — is a type of software used by recruiters and employers during the hiring process to collect, sort, scan, and rank the job applications they receive for their open positions.

Big companies have the resumes submitted reviewed under an ATS before a real human goes through them. You may want to up your game to become a start out of this. Check out the following resources:

Feel free to Google for more and more resources!

- ### Focus on your achievements other than responsibilities:

You may want to specify the impact of your responsibilities in the work experience part of your resume. For example, other than saying:

```txt
Front end design

Say:

Creating an Interactive user interface that is 
accessible and up to WCAG standards
```

Also, it is advisable to quantify your impact statements with actual and realistic data.

- ### Your Skills

Your skills are what sell your brand. It is important to categorize your skills, either soft skills or technical skills, various categories of technical skills i.e front end...

You should try and be brief and detailed oriented when listing your skills.

## Your Portfolio

A portfolio showcases what you have done with your mentioned skills. It is like the documentation to your Resume.

On this, I prefer having my own website (Online portfolio). There are no particular standards to making a great portfolio. Here is where you put your imagination into effect. i.e 

```js 
imagination.initialize(true)
```

### Conclusion

Do not be limited to my opinions or other people's opinions on how you should brand yourself. Be true to yourself and know what you looking for.
